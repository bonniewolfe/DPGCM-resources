  <div class="container pt-sm-2">
         <h2>Timezone iframe test</h2>
         <p>This should be showing the same calendar as below but with the times in your timezone.  If you are in PST, the event on June 5th is at 7am PST.  To test this, you can go to this <a href="https://savvytime.com/converter/pst-to-ist-ny-new-york-city">url</a> and put in your time zone.  The time there should match what you see on this calendar 

  </div>
<div id="calendar-container">

<script type="text/javascript">
const timezone = Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone 
const html = `<iframe src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=dpgoscommunitymanager%40gmail.com&ctz=${timezone}" style=" border-width:0 " width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>`
document.getElementById('calendar-container').innerHTML = html;
</script>
